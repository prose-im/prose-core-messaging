**Prose core views. Shared messaging views across all platforms.**

As Prose is a native cross-platform application, some views that are deemed too complex to build natively are shared between all apps. Those views are rendered in a lightweight and minimal Web view, and shared between mobile and desktop platforms. This also ensures that the Prose user experience stays consistent between all platforms.

Prose views are built on [`petite-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue), which is a super-lightweight minimal version of VueJS. This ensures that the rendering of elements such as lists stays efficient, usually even more efficient than using barebone native views. All assets get bundled using [`parcel`](https://parceljs.org/), which helps at easing development and produces an optimized production build.

## Preview

### Messaging view

![message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1451907/174491797-e6e75017-d9ca-4b6e-a3b7-d910292e3a09.png)

_ðŸ‘‰ The designs for all of the views are contained in the macOS app reference design [which can be found there](https://github.com/prose-im/prose-medley/blob/master/designs/app/prose-app-macos.sketch)._

## Installation

To install all the build dependencies, you first need to install NodeJS (version `12` and above).

Then, hit:

```
npm install
```

## Build

Building the Prose core views is done per-target environment. Please check below for build instructions based on your target environment.

### Production target

To build Prose for a production environment (that is, usage within an actual Prose app), hit:

```
npm run build
```

### Development target

To build Prose for a development environment (that is, usage from a browser, while making changes), hit:

```
npm run dev
```

Then, open a Web browser and go to: [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). Any saved changes will be hot-reloaded, meaning you will get live previews.

## Usage

Once built, all assets in `dist/` should be packaged within the Prose native app, and included in a Web view where relevant.

Serialized data should be passed to the view whenever its model needs to be updated.

### Messaging view

The messaging view can be included from path: `./dist/messaging.html`

#### 1. Pushing messages to the store

The messaging view exposes a programmatic API that lets applications manipulate its internal store:

- Check if a message exists: `MessagingStore.exists(messageId<string>)<boolean>`
- Resolve a message from the store: `MessagingStore.resolve(messageId<string>)<object>`
- Restore one or multiple past messages in the store (ie. prepend): `MessagingStore.restore(...messages<object>)<boolean>`
- Insert one or multiple messages in the store (ie. append): `MessagingStore.insert(...messages<object>)<boolean>`
- Update a message in the store: `MessagingStore.update(messageId<string>, messageDiff<object>)<boolean>`
- Highlight a message in the store: `MessagingStore.highlight(messageId<string>)<boolean>`
- Pull out a message from the store: `MessagingStore.retract(messageId<string>)<boolean>`
- Flush all content from the store: `MessagingStore.flush()<boolean>`

All inserted message objects are required to hold the following keys: `id`, `type`, `date`, `content` and `from` (with at least `from.jid` set). When updating an existing message, only modified keys need to be passed.

**Text messages are formatted as such:**

```json
{
  "id": "b4d303b1-17c9-4863-81b7-bc5281f3590f",
  "type": "text",
  "date": "2021-12-20T19:15:03.000Z",
  "content": "Hello! This is a text message.",

  "metas": {
    "encrypted": true
  },

  "from": {
    "jid": "john.doe@acme.inc",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "avatar": "data:image/jpeg;base64,(...)"
  }
}
```

**File messages are formatted as such:**

```json
{
  "id": "07b4af91-c5f4-45be-98f4-77f554c042c8",
  "type": "file",
  "date": "2021-12-21T09:04:01.000Z",

  "content": {
    "name": "crisp-keep-calm.jpg",
    "type": "image/jpeg",
    "url": "https://crisp.chat/blog/content/images/2021/03/12---3-Simple-Actions-to-Tackle-Email-Overload.jpg",

    "size": {
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    }
  },

  "metas": {
    "encrypted": false
  },

  "from": {
    "jid": "valerian@prose.org",
    "name": "Valerian",
    "avatar": "data:image/jpeg;base64,(...)"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Adjusting message view context options

The message view exposes context helpers, that let some options be adjusted at runtime.

As soon as the view is available, the following methods can be called:

**Option getters:**

- Get interface language: `MessagingContext.getLanguage()<string>`
- Get style theme: `MessagingContext.getStyleTheme()<string>`

**Option setters:**

- Set interface language: `MessagingContext.setLanguage(code<string>)<undefined>` (where `code` is supported locale code)
- Set style theme: `MessagingStore.setStyleTheme(theme<string>)<undefined>` (where `theme` is any of: `light`, `dark`)

#### 3. Subscribing to messaging events

The message view may raise events when certain things happen, such as when the user interacts with a message.

Events can be subscribed to, on per-namespace basis:

- Subscribe to an event namespace: `MessagingEvent.on(namespace<string>, handler<function>)<boolean>`
- Unsubscribe from an event namespace: `MessagingEvent.off(namespace<string>)<boolean>`

The following namespaces are available for use:

- `message:actions:view`: show the list of actions for a message (eg. user right-clicks on a message)
- `message:reactions:view`: show the list of reactions that can be sent for message
